# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, you'll leverage your Python skills and unsupervised learning techniques to predict whether cryptocurrencies are impacted by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

For this challenge, a CSV file containing cryptocurrency data was provided. The task involved using standard scaling and scikit-learn to read and transform the data into a DataFrame.

Once the data was prepared, the next step was to determine the optimal K-means value from the scaled data. This was achieved by creating an elbow curve to identify the appropriate K value and subsequently generating a scatter plot to visualize the clusters within the data.

Following the analysis with scaled data, the same procedures were repeated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

After analyzing the data using PCA, a comparison was made between the charts generated to assess which method was better suited for the task.


Due to issues with my Google Colab running HVplot I used jupyter notebook to diplay my hvplots.

In my completion process, I would first attempt to recall each of these values using my memory. Then, I would refer to the class notes and activities as a way to determine my next course of action when I am unsure or lost. After following these steps, I would consult ChatGPT to identify where I went wrong and use its assistance to correct the code. Additionally, I would ask ChatGPT to explain its process to me so that I could understand how to fulfill these tasks in the future without needing assistance.
